# Classification on Python

The dataset called "Speaker Accent Recognition," which includes voice recordings from 330 distinct speakers and is tagged with each speaker's nation of origin, is the subject of this study. The dataset has been utilized to identify the accents of speakers through the implementation of classification algorithms, 
This study's main focus is on using the Python programming language to apply the Random Forest Tree and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithms. These algorithms have been employed to learn and classify features that may be indicative of speaker accents.
